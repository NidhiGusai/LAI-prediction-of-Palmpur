# LAI-prediction-of-Palmpur
This project primarily focuses on enhancing the prediction accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, utilizing LAI data from the year 2023.


This study aimed to estimate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of wheat crops in the
Palampur Subdistrict of Kangra District, Himachal Pradesh, using various machine
learning algorithms. The study's findings suggest that multiple linear regression (MLR)
combined with key vegetation indices such as NDVI, CI, Osavi, EVI, and GNDVI, can
estimate LAI accurately. Among different machine learning models, Linear Regression had
the lowest RMSE of 0.3934, indicating its relatively accurate predictions. Additionally, it
achieved a high R2 Score of 0.6874, indicating a strong correlation between predicted and
actual values. The high Index of Agreement (0.8782) for MLR underscores its robustness
in agreement between predicted and observed LAI values, indicating its potential for
practical implementation in crop management decision-making processes.
Furthermore, the study shows significant relationships between LAI and various
vegetation indices, reaffirming their importance in remote sensing-based LAI estimation.
Except for Red Edge NDVI, all investigated indices demonstrate relevance, emphasizing
their collective utility in monitoring wheat crop dynamics. The data for all the vegetation
indices were downloaded from Google Earth Engine Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
